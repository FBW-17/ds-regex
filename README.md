In this exercise we want to train basic regular expressions.

We will use [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/) to write some search patterns.

- Write regular expression to match the following words / patterns on regexr.com:
- Check the demo text for:
    * First occurence of the word "the"
    * All occurences of the word "the" case sensitive
    * All occurences of the word "the" case insensitive
    * All words having at least 8 characters
    * All words starting uppercase and continue lowercase
    * All words starting with an "s"
    * All three occurences of the pattern "<word> & <word>"
